# claude-code-android: pinned install (native Termux, opt-in legacy path).
#
# Installs Claude Code 2.1.112, the last upstream version that ships a JS entry
# point and runs on Termux with no binary patching. Pins there and locks the pin
# against the in-process auto-updater. No glibc-runner, no patched binary, no
# auto-updating wrapper.
#
# This is the simplest, smallest path. The trade-off is that it stays at 2.1.112:
# you do not get newer claude features or fixes. If you want current claude, use
# install.sh (the default Path A) instead. This script is for people who want a
# minimal, no-shim install and are content to stay pinned.
#
# Re-run safe: every step is idempotent.
#
# Tracking the upstream issue: https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/50270

cat <<DONE

Done. Open a new Termux session, then run:  claude

  Pinned to $CC_PIN. To move to current claude later, run install.sh (the
  default Path A) for the patched native binary with an auto-updating wrapper.
